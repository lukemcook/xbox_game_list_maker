# xbox_game_list_maker

This app is for reading Xbox and Xbox 360 content IDs. It creates a text file telling you exactly what games you have in your folders which can be useful if you only have the IDs.

Usage:
Place the files inside the same folder as your Xbox or Xbox 360 content ID folders. 
Open a Terminal/Command Prompt/Powershell and run "python 360_content_id_checker:.
After running you should then have a "game_list.txt" appear in the directory with a list of your games.
