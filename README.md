# xbox_game_list_maker

This app is for reading Xbox and Xbox 360 content IDs. It creates a text file telling you exactly what games you have in your folders which can be useful if you only have the IDs.

# Usage

Place "gamelist_xbox.csv", "gamelist_xbox360.csv" and "xbox_content_id_checker.py" inside the same folder as your Xbox or Xbox 360 content ID folders.

While in the same directory open a Terminal/Command Prompt/Powershell and run "python xbox_content_id_checker.py".

After running "game_list.txt" will be created and appear in the directory containing a list of your games.
