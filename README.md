This app is for reading Xbox and Xbox 360 content IDs. It creates a text file telling you exactly what games you have in your folders which can be useful if you only have the IDs.

# Usage

Place "gamelist_xbox.csv", "gamelist_xbox360.csv" and "360_content_id_checker.py" inside the same folder as your Xbox or Xbox 360 content ID folders.
